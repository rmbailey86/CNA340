# Steps to how python7.5.py works.

One Paragraph of project description goes here.
Go into Runestone website https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Selection/OmittingtheelseClauseUnarySelection.html
Follow the steps and play with the numbers, you will notice that it saids" this is always printed." when you run the code.
If there is an error or an invaild number, it will say " the negative number x = -10 is not vaild here." 

## Getting Started

These instructions will [do something] on your local machine for [development/experimentation/demo]






## Running

x = 10
if x < 0:
    print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed")

This is always printed


## Change number and run
x = -30
if x < 10:
    print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed")

The negative number  -30  is not valid here.
This is always printed

```
python demo.py
```


## Thanks this just a practice.
